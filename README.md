Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems provide real-time, dynamic glucose information by tracking interstitial glucose values throughout the day. Glycemic variability, also known as glucose variability, is an established risk factor for hypoglycemia (Kovatchev) and has been shown to be a risk factor in diabetes complications. Over 20 metrics of glycemic variability have been identified.

Here, we provide functions to calculate glucose summary metrics, glucose variability metrics (as defined in clinical publications), and visualizations to visualize trends in CGM data.

This module currently works with [Dexcom G6 data](https://www.dexcom.com/get-started-cgm/111?sfc=7014y000000yxYNAAY&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4ejrpLHQ7gIVhbzICh1ntQ2hEAAYASAAEgKghfD_BwE).

The cgmquantify package is [now available in R!](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cgmquantify)
